# My Web Hub by Qu4ckAtt4ck

Welcome to **My Web Hub** — a central place for my web projects, where I build, experiment, and refine my skills. This hub features a collection of subsites and tools, each crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Subsites & Projects

- **Peaceable Uncooked Chicken Clicker**  
  A clicker game where chickens rule. Simple, fun, and dangerously addictive.

- **Generic Basic Simple AI Chat Bot**  
  A straightforward chatbot that simulates conversation. It’s basic, but it works.

- **WIP Soundboard**  
  A work-in-progress soundboard. Expect some chaos once it’s finished.

- **Link Tree**  
  A simple link tree to organize and navigate through my different projects and resources.
